### Fixes

* Fix compatibility issues between version 2.0.0 of [urllib3](https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/)
  and [cfscrape](https://pypi.org/project/cfscrape/)

### Dependencies

## 4.4.3

### Fixes

* Fix user folders being incorrectly saved as `Folder.x` instead of just the folder name in the database when
  running `download users` on Python 3.11
    * Also fixes `ValueError: 'Folder.x' is not in list` errors when running `download update`
    * *NOTE:* To fix user folders with the wrong content, use the `database edit` command

### New Features

* Support New Fur Affinity UI âœ¨
    * Support the new UI introduced on November 26, 2022
    * *Note:* the new UI does not show comment parents yet, but the parent comment link is still present in the HTML and
      just commented out, so the parser uses regex to extract the parent ID; this could cause unforeseen issues so be
      careful when downloading comments

### Dependencies

* Use [faapi ~3.10.0](https://pypi.org/project/faapi/3.10.0)
    * Support New Fur Affinity UI

## 4.4.0

### New Features

* \[BBCode\]
    * Thanks to the new HTML to BBCode converter introduced with [faapi 3.8.0](https://pypi.org/project/faapi),
      submissions, journals, and user profiles can now be stored in BBCode format instead of the raw HTML
    * BBCode mode can be toggled on and off using the new `database bbcode` command
    * BBCode mode greatly improves search results by removing HTML boilerplate, and reduces the size of the database
    * **Warning**: HTML to BBCode conversion (and vice versa) is still a work in progress, and it may cause some
      content to be lost, so a backup of the database should be made before changing the setting
* Database doctor ðŸ©º
    * New `database doctor` command to check entries for errors and fix them when possible
    * Users are checked for inconsistencies in their name to make sure that they can be properly matched with their
      submissions, journals, and comments
    * Submissions are checked with their thumbnails and files to ensure they are consistent, and the program will
      attempt to add files that are in the submission folder but are not saved in the database
    * Comments are checked against their parents, if the parent object does not exist then the comment is deleted if
      the `--allow-deletion` option was used with `database doctor`
* Headers and footers
    * Submissions and journals now support headers and footers as separate columns in their respective tables
    * Headers and footers can be temporarily turned off when running `download` commands using the `--content-only`
      option; when turned off journal downloads are much faster, as the program doesn't need to get each individual
      journal page
* Pre-operation backups ðŸ’½
    * New triggers have been added to perform backups before config changes, database edits, and downloads instead of
      only afterwards

### Changes

* Comments are now saved by default and can be turned off with the `--no-comments` option (the old `--save-comments` is
  no longer supported)

* Hide terminal cursor on Linux and macOS systems
* Allow second database of `database merge` command to be non-writable (e.g. if it is owned by root on a UNIX systems)

### Fixes

  last one to be downloaded/updated, and the download was interrupted manually or by an error
* Fix after-download counters not being correct if the download was interrupted
* Fix typos and errors in help messages
* Fix ` being removed from usernames

### Dependencies

With this new release comes the all-new [falocalrepo-database](https://pypi.org/project/falocalrepo-database) version 4.
Some column names in the database have been changed and the insertion functions have been made safer with built-in
checks. Search is now much more versatile and allows to query any columns in the users, submissions, and journals
tables. Thanks to the new checks, the `database check-errors` command was removed, as the new checks remove the
possibility of inserting erroneous data. The update function will notify of any faulty entry during the automatic update
of the database.

visualise submissions and journals in a friendly GUI.

The web interface allows to search the database using the same options and methods as the `database search-submissions`
and `database search-journals` commands.

Command line search commands now support `order`, `limit` and `offset` parameters for finer control of database
searches. For a more in-depth explanation refer to
the [SQLite SELECT documentation](https://sqlite.org/lang_select.html).

submissions search command is now called `search-submissions`.

The help message and readme have been fixed and missing information has been added.

The output of the `download users` command has been generalised, so it does not use "submissions" even when downloading
journals; uses "items" instead.

### Changes

* Add database command to search journals

### Fixes

* Fix missing information in help message and readme
* Fix output of download users command not being generalised

## 3.4.0

The program now uses [FAAPI](https://gitlab.com/MatteoCampinoti94/FAAPI) version 2.7.3, which supports downloading users
journals. The database has been updated to version 3.2.0 to support this change with a new `JOURNALS` table and
a `JOURNALS` field in the `USERS` table. Journals can be downloaded with the `download users` command as any other
folder (gallery, scraps, etc...) or with the `download journals` command by supplying journal ID's. Journals can also be
added manually using the `database add-journal` command. A corresponding `database remove-journals` has also been added.

The previous `database manual-entry` command has been changed to `database add-submission`.

A few errors in the readme have also been solved.

### Changes

* Database version 3.2.0
    * Add `JOURNALS` table

user entry are not downloaded again.

### Fixes

* Maintain order of users and folders passed to download
* Do not download submissions again if already present in submissions table

## 3.2.2

Submissions titles are now cleaned of non-ASCII characters before printing them to screen. Non-ASCII characters would

Exceptions raised during database updates are caught and any pending changes are committed before the exception is
raised again.

### Changes

* Safely commit and close when catching exceptions during database updates

## 3.1.7

The memory usage of database select (i.e. read) operations has been reduced by
using [sqlite3 cursors](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#cursor-objects) instead of lists. The speed of
the database update function has been greatly improved by reducing database commits to one every 10000 processed
entries (1000 for the users table).

### Changes

* Database select operations return sqlite3 cursors to reduce memory usage
* Database update speed increased by reducing the number of commits

## 3.1.6

Fixes an output error in the database update function and improves the way settings and statistics are written in the
database, using UPDATE instead of INSERT OR REPLACE

arguments from other Python scripts.

Readme has also been improved with more information about issues and contributing.

### Fixes

* Database update function updates counters of new database

## 3.0.2

Small patch to fix a search bug and output the number of results found with search.

### Fixes

* Fix search crash when using description parameter

### Changes

* Output total number of results found by search

## 3.0.1

This release is only a minor fix to change the PyPi classifier for development status of the program from beta to
stable.

## 3.0.0 - All New and Improved

Release 3.0.0 marks a complete change in how the program is run, its capabilities and future development.

Following the change of interface on Fur Affinity in January 2020, version 2 stopped working, but with this new release
the tool can once again get content from FurAffinity and is much simpler to update to support future changes to FA's web
interface.

This change was achieved thanks to the FAAPI package (from the same author of
FALocalRepo [FAAPI@PyPi.org](https://pypi.org/project/faapi)). All scraping functions are now independent of the
interface, allowing for much quicker development and response to changes in the Fur Affinity website.

The interface of the program was changed from an interactive menu to a command line tool. This allows for much quicker
execution of commands, simpler code and automation via shell scripts.

The database has been updated and is now over 50% lighter for large numbers of downloaded submissions. Furthermore, it
now holds the cookies used by the scraper, reducing the program footprint.

All database functions have been completely overhauled and are now _considerably_ faster, especially searching. Using a
500k submissions table and a modern SSD drive, searching for a specific tag takes 0,90s on average, and searching for a
string in the descriptions takes only 1,30s. Time may vary depending on search parameters and drive speed.

The last big change regards the packaging and distribution of the program. falocalrepo is now a PyPi package, easily
installed with a single pip command. All dependencies have also been packaged and distributed on PyPi and are handled
without the need for git submodules. The new distribution method allows running falocalrepo in any folder, without the
need to have the program itself stored with the database.

### Changes

* Use FAAPI package to separate scraper development from interface
* Support for new FA's interface
* Menu interface replaced with a command line tool
* Database cleanup
* Cookies stored in database
* Database queries improvements
* Command line help
* Distribution via PyPi

### Dependencies

* Set FAAPI dependency to [2.5.0](https://pypi.org/project/FAAPI/2.5.0)

### Distribution

* [falocalrepo on PyPi.org](https://pypi.org/project/falocalrepo/)

## 2.10.2

Reduced the number of indexes created and made the whole process safer. Also, interruption is now available during
indexing.

PS: Linux release is once again bigger than it should. Will work on finding a more permanent fix.

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 2.10.1

Extras' `e` option has been changed to search for ':iconusername:' and ':usernameicon:' only in the descriptions as
searching in keywords caused too many false positives in case the username was a common word/phrase.

Extras' `E` options has been changed to search 'username' in submissions' titles too.

A new 'warning' log type has been added for errors and exceptions. These will be saved in the log file regardless of
other settings. The log also has a new column for the type of log event: 'N', 'V', or 'W'

A small output error was also fixed.

PS: Linux release is once again bigger than it should. Will work on finding a more permanent fix.

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 2.10

Thanks to a special Python module created by yours truly, Windows users can now enjoy the program with safe interruption
support. The module can be found on GitHub
&rarr; [SignalBlock](https://github.com/MatteoCampinoti94/PythonSignalBlocking-CrossPlatform).<br>
More information on the feature can be found in the README.

A new function has been added to the program to correctly detect version differences as the old method was causing
errors with some versions.

New log events have been added for SIGINT (CTRL-C interruption) detection and database version.

PS: Linux release is once again bigger than it should. Will work on finding a more permanent fix.

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 2.9

Added logging to the program if launched with '--log' or '--logv' as argument (the latter logs ALL operations, thus the
v of verbose). Log is saved in a file named 'FA.log' and is trimmed to the last 10000 lines at each program start.

A new  'slow' option has been added to the download/update sections to throttle speed even further down by adding a
delay of 1,5 seconds between submissions downloads.

A critical bug in the update function has been fixed.

Argument '--debug' was changed to '--raise' to be clearer.

Search results are now properly sorted by author, id.

Some functions have been improved removing bits of unused code.

PS: Linux release is once again bigger than it should. Will work on finding a more permanent fix.

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 2.8.1

Just a small fix for an incorrect check in the analysis of submissions values.

PS: Linux release is once again bigger than it should. Will work on finding a more permanent fix.

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 2.8

A new entry has been added to the repair menu to analyze all the tables without attempting repair.

Download and update have a new 'dbonly' option that allows to add the entries to the database without saving any file.

Unforeseen errors are now caught and displayed without being too verbose. To display errors normally the program can be
run with the option '--debug'.

An important bug has been fixed in the repair section. A missing return was breaking the INFOS table repair.

PS: Linux release is once again bigger than it should. Will work on finding a more permanent fix.

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 2.7.4

Fixed an error in the URL used to search extras. An OR was missing and would stop some results from showing up.

Users selected for download/update are now properly sorted.

PS: Linux release is once again bigger than it should. Will work on finding a more permanent fix.

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 2.7.3

The search URL has been modified to avoid false positives by specifically searching only the description and keywords.
The default search employed by FA looks for search terms inside submissions filenames as well, and it could cause false
positives.

Unforeseen errors are now caught by the main script and their information displayed before exiting the program.

The header describing the various columns during download/update now reflects the new status output introduced
with [v2.7](https://github.com/MatteoCampinoti94/FALocalRepo/releases/tag/v2.7) and fixed
in [v2.7.1](https://github.com/MatteoCampinoti94/FALocalRepo/releases/tag/v2.7.1).

PS: Linux release is once again bigger than it should. Will work on finding a more permanent fix.

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 2.7.2

Fixed bugs with the new submission download status on Windows by moving it to the left of the title.

Version saved inside program is now correct at 2.7.2 (was still saved as 2.7)

The code handling the upgrade and creation of the database at startup has been slightly improved and should run faster.

New output has been added for when the database is created the first time.

PS: Linux release is once again bigger than it should. Will work on finding a more permanent fix.

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 2.7.1

Just a fix for an output error in the v2.6 to v2.7 upgrade function.

PS: Linux release is once again bigger than it should. Will work on finding a more permanent fix.

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 2.7

New outputs have been added at the start of the program to show what it is doing instead of showing an empty screen.

Download and update status output has been overhauled. The current operation is now showed in a small bracketed area at
the right end of the terminal screen. A progress bar is also shown when the submission file is downloaded (not all files
support this).

A new INDEX entry has been added to the INFOS table, it is used to save the update status of the indexes used in the
search function. Its values are either '0' if they are not up-to-date or '1' if they are.

Together with the new INDEX entry a new 'noindex' option has been added to the download/update section. If passed then
the program will not rebuild indexes after the download/update operation is completed and will set the INDEX entry to '
0' if new submissions where downloaded.

A few things have been improved around the program and some bugs removed.

PS: Linux release is once again bigger than it should. Will work on finding a more permanent fix.

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 2.6

Submissions descriptions are now saved in the database together with the submissions' data.

Search has been updated to work with the new description field, so it is now possible to search descriptions both
offline in the database and online with the web search.<br>
Case sensitivity can now be turned on/off with 'case' option in both normal and regex mode (but not online).<br>
Indexes have been added to quicken the search.

User entries have been slightly altered too: `NAME` column was changed to `USER` and `NAMEFULL` to `USERFULL`.

Repair has been improved with a new menu and a section dedicated to the `INFOS` table as well as shortcuts to optimize
the database or re-index it.

Upgrade functions have also been improved with lower memory usage.

Bugs have been fixed throughout the whole program.

PS: Linux binary size issue seems to be fixed for now.

Update 2018/05/02: Linux binary was compiled with an error, it is fixed now

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 2.5

The program is now capable of running searches on the main website. If no results can be found in the local database the
user will be automatically asked if they want to perform the search online instead.

A new 'options' field in the search menu allows enabling regex syntax and to search the website directly.

Local search can now match multiple users. For example if there are users 'tiger' and 'liger' in the database using '
iger' in the user field will match both of them.

Search output has also been improved.

A few more bugs have been squashed and some functions redesigned.

PS: I have no idea why but this release for Linux is over twice the size of previous ones. Will work on fixing it.

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 2.4

The search has been completely rewritten and should now be a lot faster. It is also now possible to search inside
specific sections of a user.<br>
Regex support has been disabled for now as it was hard to use and slowed the search down for everyone. A future update
will add an option to use regex.

A few small bugs have been fixed.

PS: I have no idea why but this release for Linux is over twice the size of previous ones. Will work on fixing it.

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 2.3

From this release the USERS table will also contain the "full" version of a user's nickname.<br>
In earlier versions user 'Tiger_Artist' would be saved only as 'tigerartist', the username used as url on the website.
However, from now on the USERS table will also contain the original name chosen by the user in a new column called '
NAMEFULL'.

The database version has been bumped up to 2.3 as well.

A few bugs have been squashed and some functions have been improved.

PS: I have no idea why but this release for Linux is over twice the size of previous ones. Will work on fixing it.

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 2.2

This new release is only a minor upgrade.

A new function has been added to check the cookies file for common errors in case a session cannot be created.

The cookies file has also been renamed to `FA.cookies.json` so that it can be opened properly as a json file for
editing. The program will take care of renaming the file.

Uncaught exceptions have also been taken care of when loading the cookies file.

Latest updates in the program used for reading keystrokes and text have also been included in these latest binaries.

PS: I have no idea why but this release for Linux is over twice the size of the previous one. Will work on fixing it for
the next release.

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 2.1

With this release all bugs with the users' database are fixed and the information are properly stored and saved.

The repair function has been expanded to include the users table. Repeating users, empty ones, names with capital
letters and/or underscores and empty sections/folders fields will be automatically corrected by the program.

A big number of bugs have been fixed as well, for the full list see
the [commits](https://github.com/MatteoCampinoti94/FALocalRepo/compare/v2.0.1...bdea9c2).

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 2.0.1

Fixed a bug in the update functions.

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 2.0

Big update and main version bump.

The program now also saves category, species, gender and rating of downloaded submissions. These can also be used during
search.

Format of the on-screen output has been completely changed for downloads and updates.

Databases can now be upgraded from earlier versions. Files from previous versions are backed up during the upgrade
process. Submissions that are no longer present on the forum will be saved with default, generalized values.

The new favorites page on the forum can now be handled correctly.

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 1.5.1

CTRL-C and CTRL-D can now be used to return to the main menu from input fields (e.g. username/sections/options)

Various small fixes

**Extra**: My gpg key was mistakenly deleted, thus all previous verified commits now show up as unverified.<br>
This new release is now verified

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 1.5

This new version comes with the usual fixes and a whole new menu entry to analyze the database and repair it. More
information in the readme.

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 1.4

The program now has a GUI! It is very simple and console-based, only a prototype of the planned one.

Search has also been added with its own menu entry, submissions can be searched for author, title and tags with regex
support.

Version has been bumped up to 1.4 skipping 1.3 due to the two major additions.

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 1.2.1

Small fix to make sure the infos table has the database name value created empty, to ensure compatibility with planned
gui.

Other changes are under-the-hood: moved some functions around and into modules to improve clarity and modularity.

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 1.2

Filetype detection now works reliably across Windows and Unix platforms!
Unfortunately safe exit still doesn't work reliably on Windows, so it's still disabled on it.

A new information table has been added to the database which stores:

* name of the database (for use in future versions)
* number of users
* number of submission
* time of last update start, in seconds since epoch
* duration of last update in seconds
* time of last download start, in seconds since epoch
* duration of last download in seconds

The table is created with all values reset to 0 in case it is not present, so it's perfectly compatible with older
versions.

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 1.1.2

The program can now be run on Windows as well!

Unfortunately due to missing libraries on Windows automatic filetype management and safe exit do NOT work so be careful.

**Warning**: Binaries are for 64bit systems only

## 1.1.1

The readme is now complete and contains all the instructions needed to use the program

Fixed a small bug in the sync code when using the Force option

A small search script has been added in the FA_tools folder

**Warning**: binary is for Linux 64bit only
